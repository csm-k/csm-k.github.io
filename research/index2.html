      <P><SPAN lang=EN-US xml:lang="EN-US">Nanomaterials/nanodevices are 
      investigated through the trinity of i) prediction/analysis, ii) 
      synthesis/fabrication, and iii) characterization/application. A new 
      synthetic approach such as self-synthesis is utilized to synthesize 
      nanomaterials. Both theory and experiments should be complemented, and 
      both chemistry and physics approaches should be combined for the effective 
      study. We create new paradigms for designing and developing innovative 
      quantum molecular/nanomaterial systems with preconceived properties so 
      that material itself can be an intelligent device. For practical utility, 
      nanodevices need to be synthesized with the self-engineering techniques. 
      Otherwise, the manipulation of each device is not practical, and the 
      mass-production is not possible. Understanding the intricacies of 
      self-engineering and transport mechanisms will provide the platform that 
      the analysis of structure-function relationship, molecular 
      interactions/dynamics, and nano-recognition in low-dimensional space can 
      be built on.</SPAN></P>

      <P><SPAN lang=EN-US xml:lang="EN-US">Recently, carbon-based devices have 
      been realized in graphene with low carrier concentration and high 
      mobility. The unusual quantum Hall effect and Berry¡¯s phase, due to 
      unusual quantum nature of confined electrons in graphene network, were 
      observed. This work demonstrated the unusual quantum transport phenomena 
      in quasi-quantum electrodynamics on two-dimensional fermion system. The 
      peculiar behaviors are essentially caused by massless Dirac fermions and 
      the nontrivial topology of the band structure in the graphene. Upon 
      application of magnetic field, the n=0 Landau level forms at the Dirac 
      point, reflecting the degenerate levels of an electron and a hole emerging 
      from the nontrivial topology of a band structure of 
      graphene.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US xml:lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      <P><SPAN lang=EN-US xml:lang="EN-US">The promise of molecules in 
      electronics comes from the diverse synthetic methodology in creating 
      complex devices with unusual functionality. Despite this promise, 
      fabrication of reliable single-molecule device has been technically 
      challenging, in part, by ill-defined bonding between molecules and metal 
      electrodes. An improved strategy is needed to create a well-defined 
      covalent bond between the electrode and the molecule. For the transport 
      phenomena in nano-scale devices, charge and spin are two important degrees 
      of freedom contributing the quantum transport. The electron transport 
      through charge channels has been studied in various experiments. However, 
      it is very difficult to achieve the spin transport through conventional 
      spin channels in metal and semiconductors. A graphene and a CNT, both of 
      which are carbon-based systems, provide intriguing quantum transport 
      phenomena. Although a CNT itself can be a spintronic device, a molecule 
      and an impurity can be inserted as a scattering center on a CNT, as a 
      molecular spin valve. We expect that a sandwiched spin-polarized molecule 
      between crossed CNTs has the special feature of a magnetic tunnel 
      junction.</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US xml:lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      <P><SPAN lang=EN-US xml:lang="EN-US">Utilizing the ultra-low friction 
      between shell layers in a long multi-walled CNT (MWNT) due to the 
      non-local nature of the ¥ð-¥ð dispersion forces, we have been successful in 
      nanoscale engineering of MWNT structures by displacing outer shells one by 
      one with AFM. This striking manipulation permits controlled modification 
      of the electrical properties. For example, thin single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) 
      with diameter less than 1 nm are mostly metallic because of the sp3 
      character against the sp2 character of thick nanotubes.</SPAN><SPAN

      self-assembly of organic molecules as a new strategy for 
      nanofabrication</STRONG></SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN lang=EN-US xml:lang="EN-US">Recently, various inorganic 
      nanomaterials with controlled shapes and properties have been developed. 
      However, despite the diversity in self-assembling organic molecules, there 
      is little progress in engineering morphologies of organic nanostructures. 
      In designing nano-architectures by self-assembling organic molecules, the 
      interplay between non-covalent interactions is more important than that in 
      inorganic nanocrystals. Indeed, the strengths of the interactions in 
      organic solids are comparable to those in solution phase. This results in 
      a dynamic equilibrium that may enable the shapes of self-assembled 
      structures to be controlled and optimized into their thermodynamically or 
      kinetically preferred morphologies. Using this self-synthesis engineering 
      technique, we can realize self-organizing intelligent nano-materials, 
      electronic/spintronic nanodevices, nano-optical devices, and 
      bio-nano-devices. We also investigated the assembly phenomena including 
      formation of molecular clusters and metal/alloy clusters, and the 
      synthesis mechanisms and quantum phenomena in functional novel 
      materials.</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US xml:lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

      <P><SPAN lang=EN-US xml:lang="EN-US">It should be noted that intuition 
      alone is generally impractical in designing nano-devices since the 
      manipulation of quantum nature can be a subtle process. Thus, we design 
      novel functional molecular systems through elucidation of molecular 
      interactions, molecular assemblies, and electron/photon/proton 
      capture/release/transfer mechanisms/dynamics. Thus, 
      interatomic/intermolecular interactions are very important in 
      self-engineering process and in designing molecular devices. Understanding 
      electron/proton pathways in nano-systems using quantum computation helps 
      design novel devices/sensors. Through investigations of the governing 
      forces and dynamics mechanisms in host-guest molecular systems and
